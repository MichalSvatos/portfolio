As a fan, **I coded and designed new UIs** for the **open source project Pi-hole** based on the Start Trek's computer interface (LCARS).

##### Star Trek: The Next Generation Theme
This theme was my first attempt to make more sophisticated and accurate version of the LCARS UI. It's based on the original blue LCARS theme, created by RD Webdesign.

##### Star Trek Picard Theme
In September 2023 I released this new, completely from scratch written, animated version inspired by Picard TV show. **With the help of awesome developers of Pi-hole, it became a new additional official theme**. Thank you, guys. I'm honored ðŸ––
