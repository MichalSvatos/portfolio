LMC (Alma Media) runs and owns the two biggest recruitment portals in the Czech Republic (Jobs.cz and Prace.cz) along with the HR recruitment platform Teamio.

**I was part of the team responsible for creating and maintaining over 400 custom client's portals.**
The devstack contained Gulp, React based components with the use of API, Twig templates, LESS, JavaScript(ES6) and Symfony on the backend.
