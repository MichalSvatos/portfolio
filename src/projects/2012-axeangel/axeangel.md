I designed a websitem, logo, banners, social media cover photos and posts for the Axe's marketing campaign "Hledá se anděl" (Angel Wanted). In cooperation with 4internet (FOR INTERNET s.r.o.)

"The 'Axe Angel Wanted' campaign, in which fans of the deodorant brand voted on the Facebook app for girls who meet their idea of an angel, was so successful that Unilever is localising it to other countries. The project, which aimed to activate a target group of men aged 18 to 24 who are difficult to reach with conventional above-the-line communications, was created by agency For Internet. Between April and June, 30,000 girls took part in the campaign and the brand gained nearly 27,000 new Facebook fans, an increase of almost 50%. _"To make the voting more attractive, it took the form of duels in which the girls continuously rotated. There were almost five million such duels,"_ says Vojtěch Šmíd from the For Internet agency. From the three-round voting, 12 finalists emerged who will shoot the exclusive Axe 2013 calendar. The project was supported by communication in online media and was linked to Maxim magazine and Óčko music television."
