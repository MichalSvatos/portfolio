In 2014, **I was in charge of designing the logo and website** for the launch of the newly opened Theatre Royal. Royal is an iconic and exclusive multipurpose cultural venue located in the centre of Prague.

In the years **I designed a variety of social media and marketing materials** to advertise the activities and shows of the Theatre.

##### Such as
- posters
- banners for streetcars
- flyers
- menus for the bar
