The website was launched in October 2012 and quickly became one of the largest food ordering platforms in the Czech Republic.<br>I was in charge of the refactoring of the frontend, with a special focus on the usability and speed. During the process, I took the initiative to improve UX/UI.<br>
I worked closely with the product managers, performed continual A/B testing and implemented changes into production, while optimising the overall user experience and website performance. Additionally, I set up coding standards, created and maintained website style guide/component library. Moreover, I designed various banners and landing pages for marketing and social media campaigns.
