perex: Small web based application for sharing text on the screen
---

I coded and designed small simple application that allows people to quickly share something on their device screen. <br>Have you ever been in a situation when you needed to give someone your email/phone or an address? Just copy, paste and show the screen. <br>Continuosly working on the project.
