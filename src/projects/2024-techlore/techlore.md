I successfully **redesigned and redeveloped** the Techlore website using **Bulma and Jekyll**. This project presented an opportunity for me to contribute to a cause I believe in, giving back to the community. I've also learned something new, such as **Liquid syntax**. I reorganized the structure of the Resources page, **creating a more intuitive and user-friendly experience**.


##### About the project
**Techlore is educating people about digital rights, privacy**, security, digital control, and other important topics to push the world towards a safer internet.
